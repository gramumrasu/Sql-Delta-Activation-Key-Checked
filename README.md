## How to check your SQL Delta activation key
     
To check your SQL Delta activation key, you need to open the SQL Delta application and go to the Help menu. Then, select About SQL Delta. A dialog box will appear that shows your registration code, license type, and activation status.

If your license type is Trial, it means that you are using a free trial version of SQL Delta that expires after 14 days. You can use all the features of SQL Delta during the trial period, but you will need to purchase a license to continue using it after the trial expires.
     
If your license type is Full, it means that you have purchased a license for SQL Delta and entered a valid registration code. However, you still need to activate your copy of SQL Delta to confirm your eligibility and unlock all the features of the software.
     
If your activation status is Activated, it means that you have successfully activated your copy of SQL Delta and you can use it without any restrictions. You do not need to do anything else.

You have 30 days to activate your copy of SQL Delta after entering a valid registration code. If you do not activate within 30 days, SQL Delta will stop working and you will need to contact support for assistance.
